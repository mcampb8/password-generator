This is program that will generate a random password for you. It will ask you which types of characters you would like to use (upper/lower case, special characters, and numbers). It also requires a password length between 8 and 128 characters or it will ask the user to try again. Additionally, it will prompt the user to go back and select at least one character type if they try to select none for their password.

I used a combination of if/else statements and for loops to create this project. It functions exactly as it is supposed to and works for a variety of criteria as input by the user.

Additionally, this is a screenshot of my deployed, working password generator.
